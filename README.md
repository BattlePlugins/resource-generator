# Resource Generator

Resource generator for BattleMcAPI. 
This project generates a handful of needed files that normally take a long time to update or create for BattleMcAPI to make the project easier to maintain.
The files are stored in a .txt that corresponds to the class the output belongs in.

To run, simply clone the project, update the needed dependencies (if applicable) and run `./gradlew run`. Text files will be created in the root directory with the output.
